## Description

This program is an implementation of the famous RSA Algorithm in **PYTHON**. In this project we have used Euler’s Totient, GCD, for checking prime numbers, multiplicative inverse, encryption, and decryption. It was required to know and understand every step of the algorithm in a detailed manner. We learned to put together different functions, convert them from a mathematical perspective to a programmer perspective, and produce a completely different output.

## Running Instructions

- If you dont have any python compiler you can use online python compiler to execute this programs
- Just go to this link https://mybinder.org/v2/gh/jupyterlab/jupyterlab-demo/try.jupyter.org wait for the load. Once load then click on new & select Python check the attached picture

- Now go to this link https://raw.githubusercontent.com/SaadAhmedx/RSA-Cryptography/master/RSA.py copy all the code paste in the jupyter notebook cell
- Run the Cell By Pressing SHIFT + ENTER
- Then It Will Ask You For Msg: ENTER YOUR MSG

- Once you enter the msg then follow instruction for Encryption/Decryption
- Your Encrypted Msg Look Like This

- Now it will again ask you for msg this time enter the Encrypted message & press 2 for Decryption
- Your Decrypted Msg Look Like This
