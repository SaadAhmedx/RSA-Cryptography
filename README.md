# RSA-Cryptography
---

## Description

This program is an implementation of the famous RSA Algorithm. To write this program, In this project we used Eulerâ€™s Totient, GCD, checking for prime numbers, multiplicative inverse, encryption, and decryption. It was required to know and understand every step of the algorithm in a detailed manner. We learned to put together different functions, convert them from a mathematical perspective to a programmer perspective, and produce a completely different output.
