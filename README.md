# RSA-Cryptography
---

## Description

This program is an implementation of the famous RSA Algorithm in **PYTHON**. In this project we have used Euler’s Totient, GCD, for checking prime numbers, multiplicative inverse, encryption, and decryption. It was required to know and understand every step of the algorithm in a detailed manner. We learned to put together different functions, convert them from a mathematical perspective to a programmer perspective, and produce a completely different output.
